/**
 * Firestore Seeding Script
 *
 * How to run:
 * 1.  Ensure you have a `.env.local` file in your project root with your
 *     Firebase configuration variables (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID).
 *     **REPLACE THE PLACEHOLDER VALUES in `.env.local` with your actual Firebase credentials.**
 * 2.  Get Service Account Credentials:
 *     - Go to your Firebase Project Settings > Service accounts.
 *     - Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON file.
 *     - **IMPORTANT:** Rename this file (e.g., `serviceAccountKey.json`) and place it in a secure location *outside* your project's source control (add it to `.gitignore`). **NEVER COMMIT THIS FILE.**
 *     - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in your *terminal* (not in .env.local) to the *full path* of this downloaded JSON file.
 *       - On Linux/macOS: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json"`
 *       - On Windows (PowerShell): `$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\serviceAccountKey.json"`
 *       - (You might need to set this variable each time you open a new terminal, or add it to your shell's profile script like .bashrc or .zshrc)
 * 3.  Install Dependencies:
 *     - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in your project root if you haven't already (to install `firebase-admin`, `tsx`, `dotenv-cli`).
 * 4.  Run the Script:
 *     - Execute the script from your project root using: `npm run seed:firestore`
 *
 * This script will:
 * - Connect to your Firestore database using Admin privileges.
 * - Add sample product data using batch writes.
 * - **By default, it DOES NOT clear existing data.** Uncomment the `clearCollection` line if you want to wipe the collection first.
